                <h2> A Visionary Leader of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose </b>(1897-1945), a revered leader in India's struggle for
                    independence, left an indelible mark on history through his remarkable achievements and tireless
                    work. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Netaji studied at Cambridge University and
                    passed the prestigious Indian Civil Service (ICS) examination in 1920. However, driven by his
                    deep-rooted patriotism, he chose to decline the appointment and instead dedicated his life to
                    fighting for India's freedom. Netaji's charismatic leadership and unwavering determination made him
                    a beacon of hope for millions. He formed the Forward Bloc as a platform for nationalist activism and
                    established the Indian National Army (INA) to challenge British colonial rule. Seeking international
                    alliances during World War II, Netaji sought support from Axis powers, showcasing his strategic
                    acumen and relentless pursuit of India's independence. His famous slogan "Jai Hind" became a
                    rallying cry for the nation, inspiring millions to join the struggle for freedom. Despite his
                    mysterious disappearance in 1945, Netaji's legacy as a national hero endures, symbolizing the
                    indomitable spirit and resilience of the Indian people. His life and work continue to inspire
                    generations, serving as a constant reminder of the power of leadership, sacrifice, and unwavering
                    patriotism in the pursuit of freedom.
